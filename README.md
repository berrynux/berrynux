   Berrynux - Offline Linux Distro
--------------------------------------

======================================
                ABOUT
  ---------------------------------

Berrynux runs Alpine 3.15.0 on x86 emulator
(which is based on TinyEMU [bellard.org/tinyemu/] and compiled 
to Javascript or WASM with emscripten [emscripten.org]).

Berrynux is modified from origin jsLinux demo of
Fabrice Bellard [bellard.org/jslinux/] in order to provide 
more disk images for specific purposes.

Goal of Berrynux is building ZIM files which can be viewed by 
Kiwix apps [kiwix.org]. Each ZIM file contains Alpine running on 
emulator and Javascript app in HTML page which serves for specific 
purposes such as:

+ Coding in Python3 [python3.berrynux.com]
+ Coding in C & C++ [cpp.berrynux.com]
+ Run other OSs [qemu.berrynux.com]
+ Run LLMs such as Gemma 3N [gemma3n.berrynux.com]

... and more ...
